<!-- Option C: Remove Employer Contributions Completely -->
<!-- 
This option removes the employer contributions section entirely.
The payslip would end with the NET PAY section and go straight to the footer.
This makes the payslip cleaner and focuses only on what affects the employee's take-home pay.

<!-- Net Pay Section (this would be the final section) -->

        <strong>NET PAY:</strong>
        <strong>KES {{ payslip.net_pay|floatformat:2 }}</strong>

<!-- Footer would come directly after Net Pay -->
