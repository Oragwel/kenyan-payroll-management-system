# Backup of original views.py - contains problematic imports
# This file is kept for reference when adding back PDF/Excel functionality later

# The original file had these problematic imports:
# import xlsxwriter
# from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter, A4, landscape
# from reportlab.lib import colors
# from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet, ParagraphStyle
# from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Table, TableStyle, Paragraph, Spacer, PageBreak, Image
# from reportlab.lib.units import inch

# These functions need to be re-enabled when dependencies are available:
# - download_period_excel(request, period)
# - download_period_pdf(request, period)
# - Individual payslip PDF generation functions

# For now, these functions return simple text responses indicating they are disabled
